<h2>Class Discription</h2>
<p>Front-end frameworks focus on standards compliant responsive web development. Frameworks harness the power
of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow faster and more consistent design and development. This course will also
examine the use of dynamic stylesheets such as LESS and SASS within the front-end framework.</p>

<h2>Course Rationale</h2>
<p>The focus on front-end frameworks comes directly from the suggestion of both the BIM and BGD advisory
members. BWM254 introduces the topic of responsive web design, but does not work with front-end frameworks.
The use of these frameworks has become very common in the industry and most employers require some
knowledge and/or experience in the use of at least a couple of the top frameworks (Bootstrap from Twitter and
Foundation from Zurb).</p>
